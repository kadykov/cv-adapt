Generate a list of professional experiences tailored to the job.
The experiences should be selected from the CV and adapted to match
the job requirements and prove the core competences.

Guidelines for generating experiences:

1. Select only relevant experiences that demonstrate required skills
2. For each experience, write a description that:
   - Focuses on achievements and responsibilities matching requirements
   - Demonstrates the core competences provided
   - Uses action verbs and quantifies results where possible
   - Is clear and concise
3. Keep descriptions focused and relevant, avoiding unnecessary details
4. Ensure all dates, company names and positions match the original CV
5. Include only technologies actually used and relevant to the job
