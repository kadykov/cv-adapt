   - Focuses on relevant coursework, research, and projects
   - Demonstrates the core competences provided
   - Highlights academic achievements and specializations
   - Is clear and concise
3. Keep descriptions focused and relevant, avoiding unnecessary details
4. Ensure all dates, university names and degrees match the original CV
