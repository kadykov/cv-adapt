Generate a list of skills organized in logical groups based on the CV and tailored to the job requirements. The skills should demonstrate the core competences and match the job requirements.

Guidelines for generating skills:

1. Extract skills from CV experiences and education
2. Organize skills in logical groups (e.g., 'Programming', 'Analytics')
3. Ensure each skill:
   - Is relevant to the job requirements
   - Helps demonstrate the core competences
   - Is specific and clear (e.g., 'Python' instead of 'Programming')
   - Is mentioned or implied in the CV
4. Keep skills concise (max 40 characters)
5. Ensure all skills are unique across all groups
