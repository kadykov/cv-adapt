# Create an application with a specific default language
app = CVAdapterApplication(language=Language.FRENCH)
```

2. During CV Generation:
```python
# Override language for a specific CV generation
cv = app.generate_cv(
    cv_text=original_cv,
    job_description=job_desc,
    personal_info=personal_info,
    language=Language.GERMAN
