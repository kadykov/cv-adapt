   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openhands/cv-adapt.git
   cd cv-adapt
   ```

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. Start the documentation server:

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- `uv` package manager (recommended over pip)

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
just install

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Frontend Testing & Type Generation

The frontend follows a comprehensive testing approach:

1. **Contract Testing & Type Generation**
   ```bash
   # Generate OpenAPI schema from backend
   just export-openapi

   # Generate types and handlers
   just generate-types
   ```
   This ensures:
   - Type safety between backend and frontend
   - OpenAPI schema validation
   - Auto-generated test handlers
   - Type-safe mock data
   - API path consistency

2. **Integration Testing**
   ```bash
   just test-frontend-integration
   ```
   - Complete user flows
   - Feature interactions
   - State management verification

3. **Unit Testing**
   ```bash
   just test-frontend
   ```
   - Component behavior
   - Isolated functionality
   - Performance checks

### Quality Checks
```bash
# Run all checks (formatting, linting, type checking, tests)
just all

# Individual commands
just format  # Code formatting
just lint    # Code style and type checks
just test    # Run tests
```
