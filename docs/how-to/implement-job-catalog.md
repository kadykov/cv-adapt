# Implementing Job Description Catalog

## Overview

The job description catalog is a core feature that allows users to manage job descriptions. This guide covers both implementation details and testing strategy.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
src/features/job-catalog/
├── components/
│   ├── JobList.tsx         # Main list of job descriptions
│   ├── JobForm.tsx         # Form for creating/editing jobs
│   └── JobDetail.tsx       # Detailed view of a single job
├── api/
│   ├── jobsApi.ts         # API functions for job operations
│   └── __tests__/         # API tests
│       ├── jobsApi.test.ts
│       └── jobsApi.contract.test.ts
└── components/__tests__/   # Component tests
    ├── JobList.test.tsx
    ├── JobForm.test.tsx
    └── JobDetail.test.tsx
```

### Routes (Completed)
```
/jobs                 # List all jobs
/jobs/new            # Create new job
/jobs/:id            # View job details
/jobs/:id/edit       # Edit existing job
```

## Testing Implementation ✓

### Unit Tests
1. API Tests (jobsApi.test.ts):
   - [x] CRUD operation tests

     - [x] Delete functionality
     - [x] Navigation links
     - [x] Action buttons

   - JobForm.test.tsx (7 tests)
     - [x] Create mode rendering
     - [x] Edit mode with data
     - [x] Form submission
     - [x] Validation behavior
     - [x] Loading states
     - [x] Error handling
     - [x] Success callbacks

   - JobDetail.test.tsx (7 tests)
     - [x] Loading state

     - [x] Error handling
     - [x] Not found state
     - [x] Action buttons
     - [x] Date formatting
     - [x] Metadata display

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all frontend tests
cd web-interface/frontend
npm test

# Run specific test files
npm test src/features/job-catalog/api/__tests__/jobsApi.test.ts
npm test src/features/job-catalog/components/__tests__/JobList.test.tsx
```

## Future Enhancements

Future improvements that can be added:
- Search and filtering
- Pagination for large lists
- Advanced sorting
- Job templates
- Bulk operations
- Export functionality

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for these future features with:
- Type-safe API layer
- Component-based architecture
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear separation of concerns
