## Understanding the Documentation

Our documentation follows the [Di√°taxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), which splits documentation into four modes:

- **Tutorials**: Learning-oriented guides for beginners
- **How-to Guides**: Problem-oriented practical guides
- **Reference**: Information-oriented technical descriptions
- **Explanation**: Understanding-oriented conceptual guides

This section focuses on the explanation mode, providing deep insights into CV Adapt's architecture and design decisions. While other sections tell you "how", these articles explain "why".
