# Implementation Plan

## Overview

CV Adapt's frontend is a modern React application built with TypeScript, focusing on type safety, component reusability, and maintainable architecture. The implementation follows a feature-based organization pattern with comprehensive testing.

## Current Status

All core features from Phase 1-4 have been completed and consolidated:

- Project infrastructure and setup ✓
- Authentication system with React Query ✓
- Job catalog with full CRUD operations ✓
  - Job listing with language filtering ✓
  - Job management UI components ✓
  - Form validation and submission ✓
  - Comprehensive test coverage ✓
- Detailed CV Management components ✓
  - DetailedCVList with language filtering ✓
  - DetailedCVForm with markdown support ✓
  - DetailedCVPreview with markdown rendering ✓
  - API integration and React Query hooks ✓
  - Unit tests for components ✓

For details on completed phases, see [docs/archive/COMPLETED_PHASES.md](docs/archive/COMPLETED_PHASES.md).
For testing strategy details, see [docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md](docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md).

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Component Architecture

```
// Feature-based organization
features/
  feature-name/
    components/  // Feature-specific components
    hooks/       // Custom hooks
    utils/       // Helper functions
    types.ts     // Type definitions
    constants.ts // Feature constants
```

### 2. State Management

- React Query for server state
- Local state with hooks
- Context for global state
- Strict TypeScript usage

### 3. UI Component Strategy

- Headless UI for accessibility
- DaisyUI for styling
- Custom components for business logic
- Composition over inheritance

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
