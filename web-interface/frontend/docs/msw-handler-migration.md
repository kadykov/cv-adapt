# MSW Handler Migration Plan

## Progress Tracking

### Overall Migration Status
- [x] Project Initiation
- [ ] Phase 1: Setup and Configuration
- [ ] Phase 2: Handler Migration
- [ ] Phase 3: Test Updates
- [ ] Phase 4: Cleanup
- [ ] Final Validation

## Background and Evolution

Our approach to Mock Service Worker (MSW) handler generation has transformed to provide:
- Simplified handler creation
- Enhanced type safety
- Reduced maintenance burden
- Consistent testing infrastructure

### Key Technologies
- **Handler Generation**: OpenAPI MSW, MSW Auto Mock
- **Type Validation**: OpenAPI TypeScript, Zod
- **API Mocking**: Mock Service Worker
- **Service Classes**: Generated from OpenAPI schema

## Goals

1. [x] Simplify MSW handler generation
2. [x] Maintain type safety and contract validation
3. [ ] Reduce maintenance burden
4. [ ] Preserve existing test patterns
5. [ ] Enable easier mock data generation

## Migration Phases Detailed Progress

### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration
- [x] Identify migration requirements
- [x] Research tools (openapi-msw, msw-auto-mock)
- [ ] Install dependencies
  ```bash
  # Pending installation
  # npm install -D openapi-msw msw-auto-mock
  ```
- [ ] Update TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Configure package.json settings

### Phase 2: Handler Migration
- [ ] Create new handler structure
- [ ] Migrate high-priority endpoints
- [ ] Validate response types
- [ ] Create test helpers

### Phase 3: Test Updates
- [ ] Update existing test files
- [ ] Verify contract compliance
- [ ] Test all response variations
- [ ] Document new testing patterns

### Phase 4: Cleanup
- [ ] Remove legacy code
- [ ] Clean up old test utilities
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Perform final review

- [Frontend Testing Guide](frontend-testing-guide.md)
- [Testing Patterns](testing-patterns.md)
- [Path Management](path-management.md)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All handlers generated from OpenAPI MSW
- [ ] Maintained type safety
- [ ] Simplified test patterns
- [ ] Improved mock data generation
- [ ] Streamlined build process

## Rollback Plan
- [ ] Maintain parallel systems
- [ ] Prepare for gradual handler migration
- [ ] Document restoration process

## Final Recommendation
Refer to the [Frontend Testing Guide](frontend-testing-guide.md) for comprehensive details on MSW handler migration and testing strategies.

## Notes and Observations
- Current blockers: None identified
- Next immediate action: Begin dependency installation and configuration
