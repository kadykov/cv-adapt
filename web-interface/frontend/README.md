# Frontend Implementation

## Required Changes

1. Install Dependencies:

```bash
# Install axios and its types
npm install axios
npm install @types/axios --save-dev
```

2. Update Implementation:

- [x] Created token service for centralized token management
- [x] Added axios interceptors for automatic token handling
- [x] Updated AuthProvider to use token service
- [x] Standardized login and register flows
- [ ] Add profile fetching after initial token validation

## Current Issues:

1. Missing Dependencies:

- Need to install axios and its types
- Compilation errors will persist until dependencies are installed

2. Profile Fetching:

- Need to implement profile fetching in AuthProvider when token is valid
- This will ensure proper initialization of auth state

## Next Steps:

1. After installing dependencies:

```bash
# Verify types are working
npm run type-check

# Run tests to ensure nothing is broken
npm run test
```

2. Test Authentication Flow:

- Register new user
- Verify tokens are stored
- Test protected routes
- Verify token refresh works
- Test logout flow

3. Add Integration Tests:

- Add tests for token refresh
- Add tests for queued requests during refresh
- Add tests for auth state persistence

## Configuration

The authentication system uses the following components:

- `token-service.ts`: Manages token storage and validation
- `axios-interceptors.ts`: Handles automatic token refresh
- `AuthProvider.tsx`: Manages authentication state
- `useLoginMutation.ts`: Handles login requests

Tokens are stored in localStorage with the following keys:

- `accessToken`
- `refreshToken`
- `tokenExpiresAt`

The access token expires after 1 hour, and refresh attempts start 5 minutes before expiration.
