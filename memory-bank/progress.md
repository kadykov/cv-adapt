# Progress Tracking

## What Works

1. **Core System**
   - CV generation pipeline
   - Component generators
   - Language context management
   - Template system
   - Multiple renderer support

2. **Backend**
   - API endpoint implementation
   - Database integration
   - Service layer development
   - OpenAPI schema generation

3. **New Frontend**
   - Phase 1: Project Setup ✓
     - Clean slate initialization completed
     - Core dependencies installed
     - Testing infrastructure configured
     - Tailwind + DaisyUI setup
     - Basic app structure verified
   - Phase 2: Authentication Progress ✓
     - Protected routes implementation complete
     - Authentication state management with React Query
     - Token persistence handling
     - Route protection with path preservation
     - Comprehensive test coverage
     - Documentation added

## In Progress

1. **New Frontend Implementation**
   - Phase 2: Authentication (Remaining)
     - Login form implementation
     - Registration form
     - Password reset flow
     - Backend integration
   - Phase 3: Base Structure
     - Component architecture defined
     - Testing strategy implemented
     - Base components pending

2. **Core System**
   - Performance optimization
   - Template caching
   - Error handling improvements

## Archived

1. **Previous Frontend**
   - Initial TypeScript setup
   - Basic job catalog components
   - Authentication foundation
