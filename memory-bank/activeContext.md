# Active Context

## Current Focus

1. **New Frontend Implementation**
   - Phase 1 completed: Modern React + TypeScript foundation established
   - Testing infrastructure with Vitest + RTL + MSW ready
   - Project structure and code organization defined
   - Moving into Phase 2: Base implementation

2. **Core Functionality**
   - CV generation pipeline
   - Component generation services
   - Language context management

## Recent Changes

1. **Frontend Phase 1 Completion**
   - Clean slate setup with Vite + React + TypeScript
   - Core dependencies installed and configured:
     - React Query for data management
     - Headless UI + DaisyUI for components
     - MSW for API mocking
   - Testing infrastructure implemented
   - Project structure established

2. **Technology Implementation**
   - Testing setup with separate unit/integration configs
   - React Query configuration
   - Tailwind + DaisyUI theming

3. **Project Organization**
   - Previous frontend archived as reference
   - New feature-based structure implemented
   - Testing patterns established

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 2: Base Implementation**
   - Create base component library
   - Implement authentication system
   - Set up OpenAPI type generation
   - Develop core layouts and navigation

2. **Testing Enhancement**
   - Add component testing utilities
   - Implement common test fixtures
   - Set up contract testing with OpenAPI

3. **Phase 3 Preparation**
   - Plan job catalog implementation
   - Design CV management interface
   - Define integration test strategy

## Active Decisions

1. **Frontend Architecture**
   - Feature-based organization implemented
   - React Query for server state
   - Headless UI + DaisyUI for components
   - Strong TypeScript integration

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests with React Testing Library
   - Integration tests with MSW
   - Contract testing with OpenAPI
   - Separate test configurations for flexibility

## Current Considerations

1. **Component Development**
   - Base component needs identification
   - Reusability patterns
   - Documentation approach
   - Accessibility implementation

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Build and test optimization
   - Documentation maintenance
   - Code organization standards
   - Performance monitoring setup
